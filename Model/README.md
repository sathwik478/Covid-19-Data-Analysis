<h1>Covid-19 Data Anlaysis</h1>

**GOAL**

To analyze the Covid-19 Dataset using Exploratory Data analysis.

**DATASET**

**DESCRIPTION**

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.The goal of this project  is to analyze the data from different countries and regions recorded over a period of time and find meaningful insights..

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

* Checked for missing values and cleaned the data accordingly
* Analyzed the data, found insights and visualized them accordingly.
* Found detailed insights of different columns with one another using plotting libraries.


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn
4. NumPy
5. Plotly

**VISUALIZATION**

![WHO Region wise Confirmed Case Distribution](<../Images/WHO Region wise Confirmed Case Distribution.png>)

![Distribution of cases in most affected Countries](<../Images/Distribution of cases in most affected Countries.png>)

![Cumulative Confirmed Cases Worldwide](<../Images/Cumulative Confirmed Cases Worldwide.png>)

![Cumulative Deaths Worldwide](<../Images/Cumulative Deaths Worldwide.png>)

**CONCLUSION**

- US had the highest number of confirmed cases followed by Brazil and India.
- According to World Health organisation's classification of regions, Americas had the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases followed by Europe and South-East Asia.
- Brazil had the most number of recoveries(keeping in mind, it had the second highest number of  confirmed cases) which suggests that the treatment procedures adopted were highly effective.
- The time series plot of 'Confirmed Cases' and 'Deaths' growed exponentially starting from April 2020 which specifies the time during which the pandemic spread wildly.
- The bubble plot for top 10 countries with confirmed cases gives the estimate idea of the widespread infection in those countries.
